      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Janhvi Verma, a passionate 9th-grade student from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. Currently studying at SICA School, I have a deep love for technology and sports.</p>
      <p>When I'm not immersed in my studies, you'll find me engaged in various activities that keep me active and challenge my mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practicing Badminton to improve my agility and strategic thinking</li>
        <li>Honing my skills in Taekwondo, which teaches me discipline and self-defense</li>
        <li>Enjoying long runs to build endurance and clear my mind</li>
        <li>Swimming to stay fit and relax</li>
        <li>Coding interesting projects when I have free time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I believe in the power of continuous learning and always strive to expand my knowledge in both academic and extracurricular areas.</p>
